# Agent

Probably just an ansible driver initially. Need to define the interface cleanly so more sophisticated ones can be done in the future. Be nice if Orbit can drive PSU, but not required.

# Coordinator

Java based service. How pluggable should workflows be? Workflows are a deep dark rabbit hole. Possible make workflows child process plugins?

# Activity Log

Postgres, no need for something exotic.
